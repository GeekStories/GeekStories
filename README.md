ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GeekStories

        I'm 24, and from New Zealand
        
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 

        - Web Development
                I first learnt how to create a webpage at High School. It kick started
                an interest that has lasted many years. I started formal studies in 2020, achieving a 
                Diploma in Web Development and Design, I've continued on to a Diploma in Software Development in 2021 through to 2023.
                Since starting, I've learnt lots of cool stuff such OpenAPI, Mobile Development using React Native
                and Full stack development using both MERN and PERN stacks. We also touched on Machine Learning using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.
                
                
        - Game Development
                I started my journey around 2012 when I was given my first computer. 
                I dabled in Batch Language, and wrote an RPG in Notepad (classic). I develop games in 
                my spare time during my studies, however I do have a handful of old projects I would like to 
                work on again! Unity Engine (C#) is my engine of choice as I've used it for multiple years now 
                and love the fact I can build to multiple platforms very easily. In 2024 I am starting a BA(Hons) Majoring in Game Development.
                      
                      
        - Cyber Security
                Also in my spare time I enjoy learning Cyber Security, more 
                specifically Ethical Hacking or Pentesting. I started this adventure on TryHackMe, working through 
                their different pathways and have enjoyed every moment since starting
       
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

        First year Universiry! In early 2024 I start my BA(Hons) Major in Game Development.
