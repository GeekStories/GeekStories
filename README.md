ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GeekStories

        I'm 22, and from New Zealand. My first ever project was a RPG game 
        written in Batch using Notepad (classic). 
        
        ps: it has since been lost to time, but a remake in notepad could be on the books
        
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 

        - Game Development
                I started my journey around 2012 when I was given my first computer. 
                I learnt Batch, and wrote an RPG in Notepad (classic). I dabble in 
                it from time to time nowdays, however I do have a handful
                of projects I plan on picking up again!
        
        - Web Development
                I first learnt how to create a webpage in my High School IT class.
                I finished my first Diploma in Web Development in 2020, and I've continued 
                on to a Software Development Diploma in 2021 where I'll 
                learn Full Stack Development with Node.
                
        - Cyber Security
                One of my things to do in my spare time is learn cyber security (top 1% on tryhackme!)
                I started on THM, working through their different pathways. My journey for cyber 
                started in late 2020, but kicked off in early 2021.
        
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

        Web Development! In early 2021 I started a 2 year Diploma in Software Development. 
        So far I've learnt Full Stack Development, creating the front-end and back-end
        of a web app/site, as well as creating, using and testing api's.
