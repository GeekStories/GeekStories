ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GeekStories

        I'm 24, and from New Zealand.
        
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 

        - Web Development
                I first learnt how to create a webpage at High School. It kick started
                an interest that has lasted many years. I started formal studies in 2020, achieving a 
                Diploma in Web Development and Design, I've continued on to a Diploma in Software Development in 2021-2023.
                Since starting, I've learnt lots of cool stuff such OpenAPI, Mobile Development using React Native
                and Full stack development using both MERN and PERN stacks.
                
                
        - Game Development
                I started my journey around 2012 when I was given my first computer. 
                I dabled in Batch Language, and wrote an RPG in Notepad (classic). I develop games in 
                my spare time during my studies, however I do have a handful of old projects I would like to 
                work on again! Unity Engine (C#) is my engine of choice as I've used it for multiple years now 
                and love the fact I can build to multiple platforms very easily
                      
                      
        - Cyber Security
                Also in my spare time I enjoy learning Cyber Security, more 
                specifically Ethical Hacking or Pentesting. I started this adventure on TryHackMe, working through 
                their different pathways and have enjoyed every moment since starting.
        
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

        Full Stack Web Development! In early 2021 I started a 2 year Level 6 Diploma in Software Development.
