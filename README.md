ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GeekStories

        I'm 23, and from New Zealand.
        
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 

        - Game Development
                I started my journey around 2012 when I was given my first computer. 
                I learnt Batch, and wrote an RPG in Notepad (classic). I dabble in 
                game development from time to time nowdays, however I do have a handful
                of projects I do plan on picking up again!
        
        - Web Development
                I first learnt how to create a webpage in my High School IT class.
                I completed a Diploma in Web Development and Design in 2020, and I've continued 
                on to a Diploma in Software Development in 2021-2023. I plan to continue studying
                in 2023  and onwards.
                
        - Cyber Security
                In my spare time, I enjoy learning Cyber Security, more specifically
                Ethical Hacking or Pentesting.. I started this adventure on
                TryHackMe, working through their different pathways and have enjoyed
                every moment since starting.
        
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

        Full Stack Web Development! In early 2021 I started a 2 year Level 6 Diploma in Software Development.
