ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GeekStories

        I'm 22, and from New Zealand. My first ever project was a RPG game 
        written in Batch using Notepad (classic). 
        
        ps: it has since been lost to time, but a remake in notepad could be on the books
        
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in 

        - Game Development
                I started my journey around 2012 when I was given my first computer. 
                I learnt Batch, and wrote an RPG in Notepad (classic). I dabble in 
                game development from time to time nowdays, however I do have a handful
                of projects I do plan on picking up again!
        
        - Web Development
                I first learnt how to create a webpage in my High School IT class.
                I finished my first Diploma in Web Development in 2020, and I've continued 
                on to a Software Development Diploma in 2021.
                
        - Cyber Security
                In my spare time, I enjoy learning cyber security. I started this adventure on
                TryHackMe, working through their different pathways. 
                My journey in cyber security kicked off in early 2021.
        
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

        Full Stack Web Development! In early 2021 I started a 2 year Diploma in Software Development. 
        So far I've learnt Full Stack Development, creating the front-end and back-end
        of a web app/site, as well as creating, using and testing api's.
