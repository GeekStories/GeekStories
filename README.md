- 👋 Hi, I’m @GeekStories

        I ejnoy coding in Unity C# and PHP! So as you would tell, most of my projects are in those languages.
- 👀 I’m interested in ...

        Game Development and Web Development. I first lernt to program around 2014 and I've been loving it ever since. It's been a hobby that I have always been fully interested in.
        My first ever program was a RPG game written in Batch using Notepad as my 'IDE'! Ever since then I've continued to learn and show a strong interest in programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

        Web Development! In 2020 I took a Diploma in Web Development and learnt the basics of PHP. 
        I remember seeing PHP in my earlier years and thinking I'll never be able to learn such a language, well I proved that statement wrong!

        Mostly any CMS projects or Unity Engine games!
